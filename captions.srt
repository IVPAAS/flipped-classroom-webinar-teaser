00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:08,587
As we've been preparing for our "flipped-classroom" webinar

2
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:11,505
We decided to experiement with "flipping" our own webinar

3
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:16,347
And this short video is our attempt to share key concepts about the flipped-classroom model

4
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:19,147
in preparation for the more interactive webinar.

5
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:23,707
The flipped classroom requires students to prepare better for class,

6
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:28,154
and for professors to conduct a more interactive session in the classroom.

7
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,346
The implementation is quite simple,

8
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:32,905
Professors pre-record a short video

9
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:36,027
about the class work, share it with their students

10
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:39,153
Students then watch the video at home at their own pace

11
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:44,346
and then, the class is used for a more interactive dialog and session.

12
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,944
There are many benefits to this model

13
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:51,788
First of all, the class work becomes more interactive and engaging

14
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:54,653
Students arrive better prepared to the class

15
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:57,985
And many students can learn at their own personal pace

16
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:02,265
There are however, a few challenges to implementing the flipped-classroom model;

17
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:07,466
Professors are often intimidated of prerecording these videos.

18
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:12,546
Many of the professors are also not accustomed to conducting interactive sessions in the class.

19
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:17,664
Students also do not necessarily like to prepare better for class,

20
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:20,235
or to interact in the classroom.

21
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:27,109
There are also practical barriers such as what technology to use when recording and sharing the videos.

22
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:34,585
At Kaltura, we are sure we can help resolve these challenges and offer ways to address them

23
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:38,506
in order to offer an optimal flipped-classroom model.

24
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:42,666
We invite you to join our webinar and learn more this topic.

25
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,108
Thank you.
